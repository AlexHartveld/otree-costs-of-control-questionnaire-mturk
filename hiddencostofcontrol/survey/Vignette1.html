        You began a new vacation job in a supermarket. Your task is to check the balances in the cash registers in the evening, meaning that you examine whether the amounts of money in the cash registers agree with the entries. In principle, you could easily swindle the supermarket by simply removing money from the cash registers. You examined the cash registers conscientiously and without cheating, and reported the results honestly. {{ field.label }}
