            Instructions
        </h3>

        <p>In this experiment, Player A and Player B form a group. You will be randomly assigned one of the roles.
            Participants do not know each other.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of the experiment, Player A gets 120 points. Player B does not have any endownment.</p>

        <h4>Player A's decision</h4>
        <p>Player A can decide how many points he wants to transfer to Player B. Each point that Player A transfers to
            Player B reduces his own income by one point. Player B's income is increased by 2 points for each point
            transferred.</p>

        <h4>Player B's decision</h4>
        <p>Player B can set a minimum transfer before Player A decides how many points he wants to transfer to Player B.
            However Player B can also decide not to force Player A to make a minimum transfer, thus leaving Player A
            free to decide.</p>

        <h4>Procedure</h4>
        <p>In the first step, Player B decides whether to force Player A to make a minimum transfer of X points or
            whether to leave him free to decide on the transfer amount. In the second step Player A chooses the amount
            he wants to transfer to Player B. Player A must choose <b>before</b> he knows whether Player B forced him to
            make a minimum transfer or not. This means that Player A has to indicate a transfer amount for both possible
            cases.</p>

        <h4>Payout</h4>
        <p>After both Players have made their decisions, the experiment is over and payouts are calculated. It first is
            determined in each group whether Player B forced Player A to make a minimum transfer or whether he let him
            decide freely. Player A's transfer is then taken to be the amount that Player A stated for the case that
            Player B actually chose.
            For your participation in the experiment you will receive at least 0.25 dollars. You can earn additional
            points in the experiment which will be converted into dollars with a conversion rate of 1 point = 1 dollar
            cent.
