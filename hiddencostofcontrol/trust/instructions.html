            Instructions
        </h3>

        <p>In this experiment, player A and player B form a group. You will be randomly assigned one of the roles.
            Participants do not know each other.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of the experiment, player A gets 120 points. player B does not get any points.</p>

        <h4>Player A's decision</h4>
        <p>player A can decide how many points he wants to transfer to player B. Each point that player A transfers to
            player B reduces his own income by one point. player B's income is increased by 2 points for each point
            transferred.</p>

        <h4>Player B's decision</h4>
        <p>player B can set a minimum transfer before player A decides how many points he wants to transfer to player B.
            player B can thus force player A to transfer a minimum amount to player B. However player B can also
            decide not to force player A to make a minimum transfer, thus leaving player A free to decide.</p>

        <h4>Procedure</h4>
        <p>In the first step, player B decided whether to force player A to make a minimum transfer of X points or
            whether to leave him free to decide on the transfer amount. In the second step player A chooses the amount
            he wants to transfer to player B. player A must choose <b>before</b> he knows whether player B forces him to
            make a minimum transfer or not. This means that player A has to indicate a transfer amount for both possible
            cases.</p>

        <h4>Payout</h4>
        <p>After both players have made their decisions, the experiment is over and payouts are calculated. It first is
            determined in each group whether player B forced player A to make a minimum transfer or whether he let him
            decide freely. player A's transfer is then taken to be the amount that player A stated for the case that
            player B actually chose.
            For your participation in the experiment you will receive at least 4 dollars. You can earn additional points
            in the experiment which will be converted into dollars with a conversion rate of 1 point = 1 dollar cent.
        </p>
        <p>The screen at the end informs you of the decisions made by both players and your earnings. The points you
            have earned are converted to dollars and paid to you in addition to the $ 0.25.</p>
