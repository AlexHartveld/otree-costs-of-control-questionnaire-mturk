            Instructions
        </h3>

        <p> In this experiment, Player A and Player B play a short game together. You will be randomly assigned one of the roles.
            Participants do not know each other.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of the experiment, Player A starts with 120 points. Player B starts with 0 points. 
            Player A can transfer points to player B.</p>

        <h4>Player A's decision</h4>
        <p> Player A decides how many points to transfer to Player B. Each point that Player A transfers to
            Player B reduces their own income by one point. Player B's gets 2 points for each point
            transferred.</p>

        <h4>Player B's decision</h4>
        <p> Before Player A's decides how many points, Player B chooses between two options: set a minimum transfer amount or not.
            However Player B can also decide not to force Player A to make a minimum transfer, thus leaving Player A
            free to decide.</p>

        <h4>Procedure</h4>
        <p>
            Step 1: Player B decides whether or not to enforce a minimum transfer amount.
            Step 2: Player A chooses the amount they want to transfer to player B, without knowing Player B's decision. 
            Therefore Player A enters an amount for each case separately - if B sets a restriction or allows a free choice
        </p>

        <h4>Payout</h4>
        <p>After both Players have made their decisions, the experiment is over and payouts are calculated. 
            For your participation in the experiment you will receive at least 0.25 dollars. Your points
            will be converted into dollars with a conversion rate of 1 point = 1 cent.
