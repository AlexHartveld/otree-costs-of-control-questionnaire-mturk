            Instructions
        </h3>

        <p>In this experiment, Player A and Player B form a group. You will be randomly assigned one of the roles.
            Participants do not know each other.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of the experiment, Player A gets 120 points. Player B does not have any endownment.</p>

        <h4>Player A's decision</h4>
        <p>Player A can decide how many points he wants to transfer to Player B by moving dots on sliders to the middle.
            Each slider can only be moved once. Each slider counts 5 points and Player B's income is increased by 10
            points for each slider moved correctly.
        </p>

        <h4>Player B's decision</h4>
        <p>Player B can set a minimum transfer before Player A decides how many points he wants to transfer to Player B.
            However Player B can also decide not to force Player A to make a minimum transfer, thus leaving Player A
            free to decide.</p>

        <h4>Procedure</h4>
        <p>In the first step, Player B decided whether to force Player A to make a minimum transfer of X points or
            whether to leave him free to decide on the transfer amount. In the second step Player A chooses the amount
            he wants to transfer to Player B. Player A will see whether Player B forces him to
            make a minimum transfer or not.</p>

        <h4>Payout</h4>
        <p>After both Players have made their decisions, the experiment is over and payouts are calculated.
            For your participation in the experiment you will receive at least 0.25 dollars. You can earn additional
            points in the experiment which will be converted into dollars with a conversion rate of 1 point = 1 dollar
            cent.
