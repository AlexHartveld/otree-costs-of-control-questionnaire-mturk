            Welcome to the demo of our two experiments.
        </h3>

        <p>
            Following these instructions are two similar experiments in a row, both with a Principal (like an employer) and an Agent (like an employee). 
            The first experiment is with a chosen effort, the second with a real effort task (moving sliders). Moving the sliders does not work on mobile, unfortunately.  
        </p>
        
        <p>In this experiment, Player A (the employee) and Player B (the employer) form a group. You will be randomly
            assigned one of the two roles. Participants do not know each other.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of the both experiment, Player A receives a salary of 120 points.
            Player B gains points depending on how many points Player A transfers to them (first experiment), or how many tasks Player A completes correctly (second experiment).</p>

        <h4>Player A's decision</h4>
        <p>Player A must decide how much to transfer or many sliders to move to the middle. In the second experiment there are 24 sliders and each of them can only
            be moved once. Player B gains 5 points for each slider moved correctly by Player A.</p>

        <h4>Player B's decision</h4>
        <p> Before Player A begins the task, Player B can decide on a minimum number of sliders Player A has to complete, or a minimum amount to transfer.
            However Player B can also decide not to force Player A to have a minimum amount, thus leaving Player A
            free to decide.</p>

        <h4>Procedure</h4>
        <p>Step 1: Player B decides whether or not to force Player A to complete a minimum number of sliders</p>
        <p>Step 2: Player A chooses the number of sliders they want to move for Player B. Player A will see whether
            Player B enforces a minimum amount of effort or not.</p>

        <h4>Payout</h4>
        <p>After both Players have made their decisions, the experiment is over and payouts are calculated.
            For your participation in the experiment you will receive at least 0.25 dollars.</p>
