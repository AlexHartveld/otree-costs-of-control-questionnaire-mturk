            Instructions
        </h3>

        <p>In this experiment, Player A (the employee) and Player B (the employer) form a group. You will be randomly
            assigned one of the two roles. Participants do not know each other.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of the experiment, Player A receives a salary of 120 points, for completing slider tasks.
            Player B gains points depending on how many tasks Player A completes correctly.</p>

        <h4>Player A's decision</h4>
        <p>Player A must decide how many sliders to move to the middle. There are 24 sliders and each of them can only
            be moved once. Player B gains 5 points for each slider moved correctly by Player A.</p>

        <h4>Player B's decision</h4>
        <p>Before Player A begins the task, Player B can decide on a minimum number of sliders Player A has to complete.
            However Player B can also decide not to force Player A to complete a minimum number, thus leaving Player A
            free to decide.</p>

        <h4>Procedure</h4>
        <p>Step 1: Player B decides whether or not to force Player A to complete a minimum number of sliders</p>
        <p>Step 2: Player A chooses the number of sliders they want to move for Player B. Player A will see whether
            Player B enforces a minimum amount of effort or not.</p>

        <h4>Payout</h4>
        <p>After both Players have made their decisions, the experiment is over and payouts are calculated.
            For your participation in the experiment you will receive at least 0.25 dollars.</p>
